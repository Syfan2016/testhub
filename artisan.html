            <h2> Biography </h2>
            <p>Born in <b>Shizuoka, Japan</b> in the year <i>1975</i>, Miyazaki grew up "tremendously poor" and often looked towards his local library as his primary form of entertainment as a child. His reading ability often fell short of the tales he obssessed
                over, and as a result he often filled in the parts he couldn't read with his own imagination; This would lead to be a big influence on his philosphies for game and story design.</p>

            <p>Miyazaki led a mostly aimless life for the first 29 years of his life, stating that he "had no dreams" as a child. He got a social science degree and worked in IT in the company Oracle, until one day his friends suggested that he play the
                game Ico. Inspired, Miyazaki decided to go into game design, but couldn't find any potential hirers, as he was too old to apply to graduate programs but too inexperienced otherwise. </p>

            <p>Miyazaki eventually took a 80% drop from his current pay to work at Fromsoft, the only company to hire him. He was assigned to work on Demon's Souls; because it was already considered a failure even before release, Miyazaki realized that he
                could do anything to the game that he wanted, without pressure of success or deliverables.</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/31/bloodborne-dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-interview">"I figured if I could find a way to take control of the game, I could turn it into anything I wanted. Best of all, if my ideas failed, nobody would care - it was already a failure."</blockquote>
            <p>The game quickly became a cult hit, and Miyazaki went on to become president of the company after producing Dark Souls in 2011.</p>
